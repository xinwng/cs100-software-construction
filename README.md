# UCR CS100 : Software Construction
## Premise
CS100 is a course that was designed to teach the principle "think twice, code once". The purpose of this course was to serve as an introduction to the construction of large software systems along with learning additional skills and methods required to do so effectively. This includes development methods, tools, infrastructure, documentation, testing, and architectural thinking. This course was taught in C++. The labs in this repository reflect the materials taught throughout the course.
